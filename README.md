# Basic-Portfolio
This is my first project as a Junior web developer in training.
This project is a brief discription of myself. 
I develop this project from scratch using purely css and html without any form of Framework or libary except the used of fontawesome for the media at the left-corner of the footer.
About the tools used for this project, please continue reading.
This is a three pages Personal website.
The width of the header, content and the footer is 960px;
For positioning of the header's that is my name at the top left-corner and the link to the to right-corner I used float left and right respectively.
